### Installation ###
* Clone this repository
* Run on Android Studio

#### Working

The app asks for read contact permissions when the image button on the side of the edittext(which really is an autocomplete textview), is clicked. The app reads all contacts of the phone and sets them to the autocomplete textview. The app lets you pick the contact, you want to pick and sets the contact's phone number on the autocomplete textview and name to a toast.
Once the permissions are provided you can also enter name of the contact you want to add, to get suggestions for autocompletion.
